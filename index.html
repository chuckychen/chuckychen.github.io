    <p style="font-size:30px;font-family:微軟正黑體;color:white;background-color:black;"> During my traveling experience, here's a list of photos what I have eaten before and I think the taste of what I like are sort of similar.</p>
    
    <ul style="font-family:微軟正黑體; font-size:25px;">
        <li>Five guys cheese burger </li>
        <img src="images/fiveguys.JPG" alt="fiveguys" height="300" width="250" />
        <P> This's my favorite burger that I had eaten in New York. Hopefully this buger chain store will open in Taiwan one day. I'm looking forward to :) </p>
        <li>Cuban sandwich</li>
        <img src="images/cubansandwich.JPG" alt="cubansandwich" height="300" width="250">
        <p>A crisp bread combined with smoked pork and topping with special mexican BBQ sauce, it tastes sour, spicy but little sweet inside. That's awesome to having this chance to taste it. This restaurant is also top 10 of best mexican food restaurants in New York.</p>
        <li>Strawberry cheese bagel </li>
        <img src="images/bagel.JPG" alt="bagel" height="320" width="250">
        <p> I love it ! The cheese is so creamy. I am the person who's addicted to any sweet food. This one is perfect for me as a wonderful morning wake up call.</P>
    </ul>
